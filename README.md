# Rustyverse

An ActivityPub compatible server node which also intends to be compatible with:

* Web3 (Wallet logins, donations, ++)
* IPFS, Filecoin For decentralized file storage.
* ATproto.com
* Matrix.org probably via conduit.rs
* ActivityPub
* More stuff?

Intends to be a GraphQL API with no preferred frontend client.

Feel free to fork. I do not really have time to build this.
